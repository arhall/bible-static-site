  <h1>Genesis Chapter 1: The Creation Account</h1>

  <div class="chapter-overview">
    <p>
      In
      <span data-scripture="Genesis 1:1">the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth</span
      >. This foundational chapter establishes God's sovereignty over creation and humanity's
      special role as image-bearers. Through six days of creative activity, God brings order from
      chaos and life from emptiness.

    <h2>Detailed Summary with Scripture References</h2>

    <div class="creation-day">
      <h3>Day 1: Light and Darkness</h3>
      <p>
        God begins His creative work by speaking light into existence (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:3"
          >Genesis 1:3</span
        >), separating it from darkness. This establishes the fundamental rhythm of day and night
        (<span data-scripture="Genesis 1:4-5">Genesis 1:4-5</span>). The phrase "And God said"
        demonstrates the power of God's word in creation, later echoed in
        <span data-scripture="John 1:1-3">John's Gospel</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="creation-day">
      <h3>Day 2: The Expanse (Sky)</h3>
      <p>
        God creates the expanse to separate the waters above from the waters below (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:6-7"
          >Genesis 1:6-7</span
        >). This establishes the atmosphere and weather systems that make life possible on earth.
        The Hebrew word "raqia" suggests a firm, stable structure that holds back the chaotic
        waters.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="creation-day">
      <h3>Day 3: Land, Seas, and Vegetation</h3>
      <p>
        On the third day, God gathers the waters into seas and causes dry land to appear (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:9-10"
          >Genesis 1:9-10</span
        >). He then commands the earth to produce vegetation, each according to its kind (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:11-13"
          >Genesis 1:11-13</span
        >). This principle of reproduction "according to its kind" becomes a foundational biological
        concept.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="creation-day">
      <h3>Day 4: Sun, Moon, and Stars</h3>
      <p>
        God creates the celestial bodies to govern time and seasons (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:14-16"
          >Genesis 1:14-16</span
        >). The sun rules the day and the moon rules the night, with stars serving as signs for
        navigation and calendars (<span data-scripture="Genesis 1:17-19">Genesis 1:17-19</span>).
        These "lights" contrast sharply with ancient Near Eastern worship of celestial deities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="creation-day">
      <h3>Day 5: Sea Creatures and Birds</h3>
      <p>
        God fills the waters with sea creatures and the sky with birds (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:20-21"
          >Genesis 1:20-21</span
        >). For the first time, God blesses His creation with the command to "be fruitful and
        multiply" (<span data-scripture="Genesis 1:22">Genesis 1:22</span>). This blessing of
        fertility becomes a recurring theme throughout Scripture.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="creation-day">
      <h3>Day 6: Land Animals and Humanity</h3>
      <p>
        God creates land animals according to their kinds (<span data-scripture="Genesis 1:24-25"
          >Genesis 1:24-25</span
        >). Then, in the climax of creation, God creates humanity in His own image (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:26-27"
          >Genesis 1:26-27</span
        >). Unlike other creatures, humans are given dominion over creation and are blessed with the
        mandate to "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it" (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:28"
          >Genesis 1:28</span
        >).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="creation-day">
      <h3>Day 7: God's Rest</h3>
      <p>
        God completes His creative work and rests on the seventh day (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 2:1-2"
          >Genesis 2:1-2</span
        >). He blesses and sanctifies this day, establishing the pattern for the Sabbath (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 2:3"
          >Genesis 2:3</span
        >). This rest doesn't imply fatigue but rather satisfaction and completion, as referenced in
        <span data-scripture="Exodus 20:11">Exodus 20:11</span>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="theological-connections">
    <h2>Key Theological Themes</h2>

    <div class="theme">
      <h3>God's Sovereignty</h3>
      <p>
        The repeated phrase "And God said" emphasizes that creation occurs by divine command alone.
        This contrasts with ancient creation myths where gods struggle against chaotic forces.
        Compare with <span data-scripture="Psalm 33:6">Psalm 33:6</span> and
        <span data-scripture="Hebrews 11:3">Hebrews 11:3</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
      <h3>Image of God</h3>
      <p>
        Humanity's creation "in the image of God" (<span data-scripture="Genesis 1:27"
          >Genesis 1:27</span
        >) sets humans apart from all other creatures. This concept is foundational to human dignity
        and is further developed in <span data-scripture="Psalm 8:5-6">Psalm 8:5-6</span> and
        <span data-scripture="James 3:9">James 3:9</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
      <h3>Creation Order</h3>
      <p>
        The systematic progression from formless void to ordered cosmos demonstrates God's wisdom
        and intentionality. This order is celebrated in
        <span data-scripture="Psalm 104">Psalm 104</span> and referenced by Jesus in
        <span data-scripture="Matthew 19:4-6">Matthew 19:4-6</span>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="gospel-connections">
    <h2>Gospel Thread Connections</h2>

    <p>
      Genesis 1 establishes themes that run throughout Scripture and find their fulfillment in
      Christ:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Word of God:</strong> Just as God spoke creation into existence (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:3"
          >Genesis 1:3</span
        >), Jesus is the Word through whom all things were made (<span data-scripture="John 1:1-3"
          >John 1:1-3</span
        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Light and Darkness:</strong> The separation of light from darkness (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:4"
          >Genesis 1:4</span
        >) prefigures Christ as the light of the world (<span data-scripture="John 8:12"
          >John 8:12</span
        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Image of God:</strong> Humanity created in God's image (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:27"
          >Genesis 1:27</span
        >) points to Christ as the perfect image of God (<span data-scripture="Colossians 1:15"
          >Colossians 1:15</span
        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sabbath Rest:</strong> God's rest on the seventh day (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 2:2"
          >Genesis 2:2</span
        >) points to the eternal rest found in Christ (<span data-scripture="Hebrews 4:9-10"
          >Hebrews 4:9-10</span
        >)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="study-questions">
    <h2>Study Questions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        What does it mean that humans are created "in the image of God" (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 1:27"
          >Genesis 1:27</span
        >)? How does this affect how we view ourselves and others?
      </li>
      <li>
        How does the pattern of God's creative work (speaking, making, blessing) reveal His
        character?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the significance of God's rest on the seventh day (<span
          data-scripture="Genesis 2:2-3"
          >Genesis 2:2-3</span
        >)? How does this relate to our need for Sabbath?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you see Christ reflected in the creation account? (Consider
        <span data-scripture="John 1:1-3">John 1:1-3</span> and
        <span data-scripture="Colossians 1:16">Colossians 1:16</span>)
