  "blurb": "Eve, ‘mother of all living’ (Gen 3:20), is created as Adam’s counterpart and partner in the divine mission. Deceived by the serpent, she eats and gives to Adam; yet she becomes the bearer of the promise that her seed will crush evil (Gen 3:15). Jewish midrash explores her complexity; Christian tradition pairs Eve with Mary as a reversal motif: where Eve believed the serpent, Mary believed God.",
