  "blurb": "Primary voice of the Song—dark yet lovely, vineyard worker turned garden of delight. She initiates pursuit (1:2–4), seeks at night (3:1–4), and claims mutual belonging (2:16; 6:3; 7:10). Background & Solomon: The text names Solomon (1:1; 3:7–11; 8:11–12) and portrays the bridegroom with royal imagery; some read the woman as **Solomon’s beloved** (Shulammite ≈ ‘Shunammite’), others see her as independent of the king, even contrasting her personal vineyard with Solomon’s commercial vineyard (8:11–12). Either way, her agency and fidelity stand central—love is covenantal, voluntary, and resilient.",
