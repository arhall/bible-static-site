  "blurb": "Adam, formed from dust and enlivened by God’s breath, embodies humanity’s vocation: to image God, cultivate creation, and live by God’s word (Gen 2:7–17). His failure in Eden fractures fellowship with God and distorts human relationships. Jewish tradition remembers Adam as both glorious and tragic; Christian theology contrasts Adam with Christ—the ‘last Adam’ who obeys where Adam failed. Adam’s story explains the human condition and sets the pattern for exile and the hope of return.",
